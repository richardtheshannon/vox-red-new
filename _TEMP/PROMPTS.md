/* DO NOT REMOVE THE FOLLOWING PLACEHOLDER PROMPT:

### Read CLAUDE.md  in the _TEMP directory add it to context.  Stop and warn me if our development might harm or break functionality or layouts. I am running "npm run dev" already on http://localhost:3000/ in another terminal. Warn me when I am at 75% of my limit. All edits should be as minimal as possible. Be surgical and precise. All updates should use as many existing systems and resources as possible and only introduce new installments when absolutely necessary.

Read challenge-feature-guide.md  in the _TEMP directory add it to context.

Update CLAUDE.md in the _TEMP directory, with any relevant application update overviews.

### Lets get ready to push to railway, please run: npm run db:validate | Expected output: Should show "No pending migrations" or analyze your latest migration, and then run: npx tsc --noEmit | Final TypeScript Check
Lets push to github for railway deployment.
git add .&& git commit -m "general quick commit" && git push origin master

Deployment failed. Please read ERROR.md in the _TEMP directory. 

### Revise and update CLAUDE.md in the _TEMP directory to only contain essential application information for continued development. This should be a concise, specific, outline of the application. Lets keep it under 500 lines.
