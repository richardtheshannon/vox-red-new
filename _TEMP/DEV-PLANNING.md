# ICON SELECTIONS & FUNCTIONS
IF the "select_check_box" icon is selected for a slide on the back end, I would like that icon when selected by the user on the front end to unpublish that slide. This should be live. Once unpublished the slide should effectively "disappear"

If the "check_circle_unread" icon is selected for a slide on the back end, I would like that icon when selected by the user on the front end to unpublish that slide until 1am, at 1am the slide should reset and be republished so that it remains visible until this icon is selected again, or its unpublished via other means. This should be live. Once unpublished the slide should effectively "disappear" and the next available slide in the row we are currently viewing should show. In the back end, lets color the "check_circle_unread" icon green (consistant with the "select_check_box") to indicate it has functionality to it. This icon function should be available on individual slides, and on the row settings for icon slides (applied to all slides in the row).
