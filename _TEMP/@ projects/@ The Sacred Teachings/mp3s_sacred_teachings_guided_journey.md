The Sacred Teachings: A Guided Journey. Welcome, my child. Sit with me by this fire. What I share with you now has been carried through countless generations, like water flowing through the canyon, shaping all it touches. These teachings are not mine alone—they belong to all people who seek to walk in balance upon this Earth. Listen with your heart, not just your ears.**


Teaching One: The Conquest of Fear. "So live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart." This is where we must begin. Not at the end, but at the beginning—with how you choose to live each breath. Fear of death is a shadow that makes the living forget to live. It creeps into the heart like winter frost and freezes the spirit in place. But I tell you this truth: when you live with purpose, with honor, with love—death becomes not an enemy, but simply a doorway. Your lesson: Today, notice when fear holds you back from speaking truth, from showing love, from taking right action. Ask yourself: "Am I living, or am I merely avoiding death?" There is a difference as vast as the sky. Sit with this teaching. When you are ready, continue to the next fire.

Teaching Two: The Sacred Right of Belief. "Trouble no one about their religion; respect others in their view, and demand that they respect yours." The Great Mystery speaks to each person in their own tongue, appears in their own visions. The mountain does not tell the river how to flow. The eagle does not instruct the wolf in hunting. Each follows their own path. Your beliefs are yours—held in your heart as sacred. But so are the beliefs of every other person who walks this Earth. To force your truth upon another is to say: "My spirit sees better than yours." This is the height of arrogance. Your lesson: Practice this three-part wisdom: First, honor your own beliefs without shame. Second, respect the spiritual path of others, even when it differs from yours. Third, stand firm when others would disrespect what is sacred to you. Like the old tree—rooted but not rigid, strong but allowing the wind to pass through. Breathe this teaching in. Let it settle in your bones. Then move forward.

Teaching Three: The Great Work of Living. "Love your life, perfect your life, beautify all things in your life." Here are three commands, each a universe unto itself. "Love your life." Not the life you wish you had. Not the life your neighbor has. This life—the one you are living right now, with all its scars and gifts. Love it the way the Earth loves the rain, receiving all that comes. "Perfect your life." This does not mean to make it flawless, for there is no such thing. It means to make it whole. To tend to it like a garden, pulling the weeds of bitterness, planting seeds of wisdom, watering it with attention and care. "Beautify all things in your life." Beauty is not decoration—it is sacred order. It is treating each moment, each object, each encounter as worthy of reverence. When you cook your food with love, you beautify. When you speak with kindness, you beautify. When you work with pride, you beautify. Your lesson: Choose one thing in your life today—a task, a relationship, a space—and beautify it. Not for others to see, but as an offering to the Great Spirit that gave you this life. This teaching is a practice, not just a thought. Live it before moving on.

Teaching Four: The Long Path of Service. "Seek to make your life long and its purpose in the service of your people." I did not say "live long." I said "make your life long." There is a difference. A life is made long not by the number of winters you survive, but by the depth of meaning you weave into each day. A person who lives thirty years in service to their people has lived longer than one who lives ninety years serving only themselves. And who are "your people"? They are your family, yes. Your tribe, yes. But as you grow in wisdom, you will find that your people expand—they include all who need what you have to give. Your people are those whose lives are touched by your presence, whose burdens are lightened by your strength, whose darkness is illuminated by your fire. Your lesson: Ask yourself these questions in stillness: What gifts has the Great Spirit placed in my hands? How can these gifts serve others? What small act of service can I perform today? Service need not be grand—a cup of water given in truth is as sacred as a feast. Reflect deeply. Let this truth root itself in you. Then continue.

Teaching Five: Preparing the Final Song. "Prepare a noble death song for the day when you go over the great divide." In our tradition, a warrior prepares their death song—not out of morbidity, but out of clarity. This song says: "This is who I am. This is what I stood for. This is how I lived." Your death song is not written in a day. It is composed through a lifetime of choices. Each act of courage adds a note. Each truth spoken adds a verse. Each love given adds harmony. To prepare your death song is to live with the end always visible, not to make you fearful, but to make you focused. When you know you must one day stand before the Creator and sing of your life, you become very careful about what notes you add to that song. Your lesson: If you had to sing your death song today—right now—what would it say? Would it be a song of courage or of hiding? Of love or of coldness? Of truth or of deception? Begin now to compose a song worthy of singing when you cross over. Live the verses you wish to sing. This teaching requires courage to face. Sit with it until you find that courage. Then proceed.

Teaching Six: The Sacred Greeting. "Always give a word or a sign of salute when meeting or passing a friend, even a stranger, when in a lonely place." In the acknowledgment of another, we acknowledge the spark of the Great Mystery that dwells in all beings. To pass another in silence, without recognition, is to say: "You do not exist to me." This is a kind of death. In the lonely places especially—where fear might make us suspicious, where isolation might make us cold—there we must be most human. There we must remember: this stranger is someone's child, someone's beloved, carrying their own sacred fire through the wilderness. A word. A nod. A gesture of peace. These small things are not small. They are threads that weave the great blanket of human connection. Without them, we each stand alone in the cold. Your lesson: For seven days, practice this: greet every person you encounter with intention. Not as an automatic gesture, but as a conscious choice to recognize their humanity. See what shifts in you when you do this. See what shifts in them. Let this practice become your way of walking in the world. When it feels natural, continue.

Teaching Seven: The Dignity of All. "Show respect to all people and grovel to none." Here is a profound balance, as crucial as the balance between day and night. Respect all people. The poor and the rich. The wise and the foolish. The powerful and the powerless. Each carries the same divine spark, no matter how dimmed or how bright it appears. To withhold respect is to claim you are the judge of worth. You are not. But grovel to none. Do not demean yourself before any person, no matter their position. To grovel is to forget your own sacred nature. It is to lie about who you are—to pretend you are less than you are. This too is a sin, for it rejects the gift of spirit the Creator placed within you. Stand tall. Bow to none. But honor all. Your lesson: Notice where you have been groveling—where you make yourself small to please others, where you betray your own truth for acceptance. Also notice where you have withheld respect from those you deemed unworthy. Correct both. Be a tree that knows its own height and honors the forest around it. This teaching shapes your stance in the world. Practice it until it becomes your bones. Then continue.

Teaching Eight: The Morning Gratitude. "When you arise in the morning give thanks for the food and for the joy of living. If you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault lies only in yourself." Each morning you are given is a gift. You did not earn it. You did not purchase it. You did not make it happen. It was given to you by forces greater than your understanding. And with it comes food to sustain you and the possibility of joy. But hear this hard truth: if you cannot find reason to give thanks, the problem is not with the world—it is with your vision. Gratitude is not dependent on circumstances being perfect. It is a way of seeing that recognizes the gift embedded in existence itself. The ungrateful heart is a hard ground where nothing can grow. The grateful heart is soft soil where even in winter, green shoots can emerge. Your lesson: Begin each day with this practice: before you rise, before you check your worries, speak aloud three things for which you are grateful. Do this for thirty days. If you think you have nothing to be grateful for, start with breath. Start with sight. Start with the fact that you woke at all. The practice will teach you what I cannot. This teaching is a discipline. Practice it faithfully. When gratitude becomes your morning language, proceed.

Teaching Nine: The Sacredness of All Things. "Abuse no one and no thing, for abuse turns the wise ones to fools and robs the spirit of its vision." Abuse is the opposite of sacred relationship. It is using without honoring. Taking without giving. Harming without necessity. You can abuse a person—this you know. But you can also abuse the land, the water, the animals, the plants. You can abuse your own body, your own gifts, your own time. Abuse is any action that shows contempt for the sacred nature of what has been entrusted to you. And here is what abuse does: it makes the wise foolish and robs the spirit of vision. Why? Because abuse requires you to stop seeing truly. To abuse, you must first blind yourself to the worth of what you harm. This blindness does not remain only there—it spreads like poison through your whole way of seeing. You become a person who cannot see the sacred anywhere, and this is the definition of a fool, no matter how much knowledge they possess. Your lesson: Look at your life honestly. Where are you abusing? Perhaps it is how you speak to yourself in your inner voice. Perhaps it is how you treat your body. Perhaps it is how you use the gifts of the Earth without thought. Perhaps it is how you speak to others when you are angry. Name it. Then stop. Replace abuse with reverence. This is the warrior's path. This teaching requires brutal honesty. Do not move forward until you have faced yourself truly.

Teaching Ten: The Two Ways of Dying. "When it comes your time to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with the fear of death, so that when their time comes they weep and pray for a little more time to live their lives over again in a different way."

There are two ways to approach the end. The first way is filled with regret. These are the ones who, at the final moment, realize they lived a life that was not theirs. They followed others' paths. They hid their truth. They let fear choose their actions. They postponed their real living, always saying "tomorrow, tomorrow." And now there are no tomorrows left, and they weep for all the life they never lived. This weeping is not the sadness of leaving—it is the agony of never arriving. It is the grief of looking back and seeing a trail of unlived moments, unspoken words, unloved loves, untaken courage. They beg for more time, not because life was so sweet, but because they finally see what life could have been and they missed it. Do you see why this matters now, while you still have mornings ahead of you? The time to live the life you will be proud of is now. Not when you are old. Not when you are comfortable. Not when you are ready. Now. Your lesson: If you died today and could look back at your life, what would you regret? What would you wish you had done differently? These answers are not meant to torment you—they are meant to guide you. You still have time. Use it. Sit with this uncomfortable truth. Let it burn away what is false. Then move to the final teaching.

Teaching Eleven: The Song of Homecoming. "Sing your death song and die like a hero going home." This is the other way to die. This is the way of completion. When you have lived well—when you have loved deeply, served truly, stood with courage, treated all with respect, given thanks, harmed none unnecessarily, beautified your life, and made each day count—then death is not a tragedy. It is a homecoming. You sing your death song without shame, without regret, without fear. You sing it as a statement: "This is what I did with the gift I was given." And you die like a hero—not because you conquered others, but because you conquered yourself. You conquered your fear. You conquered your selfishness. You conquered your small vision and chose to live large. Going home. Not into darkness, but into light. Not into ending, but into continuation. Not into loss, but into return. Back to the Great Mystery from which you came, carrying with you the gift of a life well-lived. This is not just about the final moment. This is about today. This is about now. You are either living the kind of life that will allow you to sing proudly when the time comes, or you are not. The choice is always, always, always yours. Your final lesson: Imagine your death song. What would you sing? What verses would it have? What would be its chorus? Then—and this is the great work—live in such a way that when the time comes, you can sing it with your whole heart, knowing every word is true.

Closing: The Path Forward. You have received these teachings. But receiving is not the same as living. These words are seeds. They will not grow unless you plant them in the soil of your daily life, water them with your attention, and tend them with your practice. Do not try to master all teachings at once. That is the way of the fool who wants wisdom without work. Choose one. Live with it until it changes you. Then choose another. Come back to these teachings when you are lost. Come back when you are found. Come back when you are young. Come back when you are old. Each time, you will find something new, for you will be someone new. Walk in beauty. Walk in balance. Walk with courage. And when your time comes to cross over the great divide, may your death song be strong and true. The fire has burned low. The teaching is complete. Go now. Live these truths.
